"""
Tests for transaction safety in database operations.

This module contains tests that verify the proper handling of transactions
in the database module, ensuring that:

1. Operations are properly committed or rolled back
2. Connection isolation is maintained
3. Concurrent transactions behave correctly
4. Nested transactions are handled correctly
5. Complex transaction chains maintain data integrity
