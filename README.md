### Components and their interaction

-   **FastAPI App (`deployment/`)**: The central orchestrator component. It provides a REST API for user interaction, manages the database (metadata, tasks, results), and initiates tasks (training, tuning) in Yandex DataSphere.
-   **ML Module (`plastinka_sales_predictor/`)**: This is not a separate service, but a Python package containing all the machine learning logic (data preparation, TiDE model architecture, metrics). This code is packaged and executed directly in the Yandex DataSphere cloud environment.
- **Infrastructure (`deployment/infrastructure/`)**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) based on Terraform. These configurations describe and create all the necessary cloud resources in Yandex Cloud, including the DataSphere project and access rights. This is a component of the deployment stage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide provides the steps to set up the project from scratch.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python & `uv`**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. This project uses `uv` for package management. Install it with:
  ```bash
  # macOS / Linux
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  # Windows
  powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```
- **Terraform / OpenTofu**: Install either [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) to manage cloud infrastructure.
- **Yandex Cloud Account**: You need a Yandex Cloud account with an organization and folder.

### 2. Set Up Infrastructure

Terraform automatically creates the cloud resources and a `.env` file in the project root with the necessary API keys.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the infrastructure configuration directory
cd deployment/infrastructure/envs/prod

# 2. Create a variables file from the example
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars

# 3. Edit terraform.tfvars with your Yandex Cloud IDs
# (yc_cloud_id, yc_folder_id, yc_organization_id)

# 4. Set your Yandex Cloud OAuth token as an environment variable
export TF_VAR_yc_token="your-yc-oauth-token"

# 5. Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration
terraform init
terraform apply
```
This will create the necessary DataSphere resources and populate the `.env` file at the project root.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the infrastructure is ready, install the Python dependencies.

```bash
# From the project root
uv sync
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
python deployment/run.py
```
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, and the documentation can be found at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## 🔄 Core Workflow

The system is designed around a monthly operational cycle. This workflow is the primary use case for the API.

1.  **Upload Data**: At the beginning of a new month, upload the sales data for the past month and the current stock levels.
    - `POST /api/v1/jobs/data-upload`
2.  **Monitor Upload Job**: Track the status of the data processing job.
    - `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}`
3.  **Check System Health (Optional but Recommended)**: Verify that the data is consistent and the system is ready for training.
    - `GET /health`
4.  **Trigger Model Training**: Start a new training job in Yandex DataSphere. This process trains the model on the complete, updated dataset and generates predictions for the next period.
    - `POST /api/v1/jobs/training`
5.  **Monitor Training Job**: Track the training process, which can take a significant amount of time (e.g., ~2 hours).
    - `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}`
6.  **Trigger Hyperparameter Tuning (If Needed)**: If the model performance degrades over time (indicated by the `/health` endpoint), run a tuning job to find better hyperparameters. After tuning, you must re-run the training job (Step 4).
    - `POST /api/v1/jobs/tuning`
7.  **Retrieve Report**: Once training is complete, fetch the prediction report.
    - `POST /api/v1/jobs/reports`
